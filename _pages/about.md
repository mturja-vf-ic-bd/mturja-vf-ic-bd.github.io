I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I am advised by Dr. Martin Styner. Before that, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

My expertise lies in the domain of Graph Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal data and I am passionate about applying this expertise to understand how the human brain works.
